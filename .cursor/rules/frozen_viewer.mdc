The frozen viewer is a static version of the viewer that is generated using the `freeze_viewer.py` script.

Goal: A static version of the viewer that can be served without a Flask server and hosted on github pages.

## Basic idea

Produce fully rendered html files for all the pages in the viewer.
Do not load from any json etc., just produce html files.

## Content that should be shown

- Trajectories
- Changes

## Things to remove

- Everything related to AWS, or S3 storage
- Any actions
- Any caching etc.
