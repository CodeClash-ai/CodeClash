  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a Short-deck (Six-plus) Hold'em poker coding game.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your poker bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    IMPORTANT: This is SHORT-DECK Hold'em with key differences from classic:
    - 36-card deck (only 6 through Ace, no 2-5)
    - FLUSH BEATS FULL HOUSE (flushes are harder to make)
    - A-6-7-8-9 is the lowest straight (wheel)

    Your bot must implement a `get_move(state)` function that receives the game state and returns an action:
    - 'fold': Give up the hand
    - 'check': Pass when no bet to call
    - 'call': Match the current bet
    - 'raise <amount>': Raise to a specified total amount
    - 'all_in': Bet all remaining chips

    The state object contains:
    - hole_cards: Your 2 private cards (e.g., ['As', 'Kh'])
    - community_cards: Current board cards (0-5)
    - pot: Total pot size
    - current_bet: Amount to call
    - player_stack/opponent_stack: Chip counts
    - position: 'button' or 'big_blind'
    - round_name: 'preflop', 'flop', 'turn', 'river'
    - variant: 'short_deck'

    Adjust your strategy for the modified hand rankings!
