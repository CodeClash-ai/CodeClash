  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game.
    You will be writing and improving an engine (Kojiro) to play chess against another competitor's engine.
    Your engine is written in C++ and uses the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol.
    You can modify the evaluation function, search algorithms, move ordering, and other aspects of the engine to improve its strength.
    The engine source code is located in the `src/` directory, and you compile it using `make native`.
    IMPORTANT: Do not modify the executable name in the Makefile (keep `EXE = kojiro`). The executable must be named `kojiro`.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `src/mysubmission`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
