    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called Figgie.
    Figgie is a card trading game invented at Jane Street that simulates open-outcry commodities trading.

    Game Rules:
    - 4 players, each starting with $350 and 10 cards (40 cards total)
    - Deck: one 12-card suit, two 10-card suits, one 8-card suit
    - Goal suit: same color as 12-card suit, contains 8 or 10 cards (secret until end)
    - Players ante $50 each to form a $200 pot
    - At end: $10 per goal suit card, remainder to player(s) with most goal suit cards

    Your bot (main.py) must implement:
        def get_action(state: dict) -> dict

    Return one of:
    - {"type": "pass"}
    - {"type": "bid", "suit": "spades", "price": 5}
    - {"type": "offer", "suit": "spades", "price": 10}
    - {"type": "buy", "suit": "spades"}
    - {"type": "sell", "suit": "spades"}

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitors finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `main.py`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
