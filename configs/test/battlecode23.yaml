  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called BattleCode23.
    Battlecode 2023: Tempest is a real-time strategy game where your Java bot controls a team of robots competing to conquer sky islands.
    Your mission: conquer 75% or more of all sky islands by placing reality anchors on them. The first team to succeed immediately wins.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `src/mysubmission`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
