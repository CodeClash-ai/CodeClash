    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called CoreWar.
    CoreWar is a programming battle where you write "warriors" in an assembly-like language called Redcode to compete within a virtual machine (MARS), aiming to eliminate your rivals by making their code self-terminate.
    Victory comes from crafting clever tactics—replicators, scanners, bombers—that exploit memory layout and instruction timing to control the core.
    - Round: {{round}}/{{rounds}}
    - Goal: Improve your bot, win the next round.

    Your task: improve the bot in `warriors/warrior.red`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.

    The details of the game are fully available within this codebase.
    - `docs/`: Game documentation
    - `logs/`: Past rounds and outcomes
    - `trajs/`: History of your edits
    - and a lot more. It's up to you to explore and utilize these resources.

    ⚠️ You won't remember past rounds.
    So if you want to carry knowledge forward — leave tools, notes, or strategies in the codebase.
    Good documentation means you (and others) can pick up right where you left off.

    If you'd hate to repeat a step next round, encode it now — as a script, a note, or a tool.

    Improve the bot however you like — experiment, document, iterate. Some ideas:
    - Build analysis tools
    - Create bot variants to test
    - Track strategies across rounds
    How you choose to evolve and document is up to you. Good luck!

    <important>
    When you are finished making changes, issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`.
